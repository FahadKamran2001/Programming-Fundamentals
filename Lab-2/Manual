Lab Tasks

Problem 01
Write a program that takes mass as an input and calculates the weight of an object using formula:

Weight = mass x 9.8

Choose the data types wisely.
Problem 02
Write a program that converts inches to yards and feet. Prompt the user to enter an integer value i.e. the
number of inches, and then make the conversion and output the result in the following format.
03 yards: 20 feet : 45 inches
Note: 1 ft = 12 inches 1 yard = 3ft

Problem 03
Write a program for the following mathematical trick.
Ask user for any number. Double it. Add 10 to it. Now half the number. Then subtract your first number.
The answer will be five.

Note: Perform the above task with only one mathematical equation. Keep the concept of operator
precedence in mind.
Problem 04
Write a program that takes sales unit price and sales quantity of only two items as input and compute the
total sales amount. After that calculates 10% tax on total sales amount. Display the total sales amount
before and after tax deduction.
Note: Consider only two items.
Problem 05
Write a program to find whole square of three numbers by the following formula

(a + b + c) 2

= a2 + b2 + c2 + 2 (ab + bc + ca)

Note: Get the values of a, b and c from user.
