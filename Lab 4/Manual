Question #1:
Write a C++ program to ask user to enter a number and check whether the entered number is zero or
negative number or positive number.
Note: Use switch within a Switch (Nested Switch)
Question #2:
Write a C++ program to take a whole number in the range of 1 and 99999 as input from the user and
show the number of digits entered by user. Example:

• if enters 7, the program should show "You have Entered a 1 Digit Number"
• if enters 342, the program should show "You have Entered a 3 Digit Number",
• if enters some other number, show "Invalid Input".
Note: Use ternary operators and Switch Case Statement.
Question #3:
Write a C++ program to check whether an entered year is Leap year or not using Ternary operators. And
repeatedly ask input from user until input year is not 0.
Question #4:
Write a C++ program to find the number of days in a month using Switch...case. Use best approach for this
program.
Note: Instead of repeating same action on multiple cases, you can group similar cases together and perform
single action on group of cases. To group, arrange all similar cases one after other and remove break statement
from all cases other than last case.
Question #5:
In a Math class, students are asked to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation. Students find that a quadratic
equation can have either one or two distinct real or complex roots depending upon nature of discriminant of the
equation. Where discriminant of the quadratic equation is given by

Case 1: If discriminant is zero, roots can be

Case 2: If discriminant is positive. Roots will be:

Case 3: If discriminant is negative. Then it will have two distinct complex roots given by.

Now, write a C++ program to find the roots of quadratic equation using Switch...case. First take inputs from user
of quadratic equations (aX^2 + bX + c), Calculate discriminant and then compute roots of quadratic equation
based on the nature of discriminant using nested switch case.

Question #6:
METRO’s store is having a sale on everything in the store. Customers will receive additional discounts on their
total purchase depending upon how much they buy. Write a C++ program that asks for the total purchase from
the user and then take the amount to calculate the discount and new amount, then print out all the 3 values.
The discount scheme is as fellow:

Total Purchase Discount
Less than 1000 10%
1000 to 2000 20 %
2000 to 5000 30%
5000 to 7500 40%
Above 7500 50%

Output should be look like this

Total Purchase Rs/- 5225
Discount Rs/- 2090
----------------------------
New Price Rs/- 3135
Thank you for shopping with us

Note: Use ternary operator to solve the problem
