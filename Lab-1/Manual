Programming Fundamentals Lab-3
Insertion operator , setw & setprecision functions


Exercise 1: A Simple First Program
You need to perform the following to complete the task.
1.	Open the Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + t)
2.	Installation g++
lab@lab-OptiPlex-330:~$ sudo apt install g++

Note: g++ is already install on lab PCs
3.	Create file of .cpp file extension using touch command
~$ touch helloworld.cpp

4.	Now open the text editor using gedit command
~$ gedit helloworld.cpp

5.	Write the helloworld code in helloworld.cpp file.


6.	Save and close the file.
7.	compile and execute it
~$ g++ -o hello helloworld.cpp
~$./hello
 
Standard output (cout)
cout is a C++ stream object, used for standard output by default is the screen. For formatted output operations, cout is used together with the insertion operator, which is written as << (i.e., two "less than" signs).



Escape Sequences

Character combinations consisting of a backslash (\) followed by a letter or by a combination of digits are called "escape sequences." To represent a newline character, single quotation mark, or certain other characters in a character constant, you must use escape sequences. An escape sequence is regarded as a single character and is therefore valid as a character constant. Escape sequences are used to format our output. The following escape sequences can be used to print out special characters.

Escape Sequence	Description
\n	Newline
\t	Horizontal tab
\\	Backslash
\'	Single quote
\"	Double quote


To insert a line break, a new-line character shall be inserted at the exact position the line should be broken. In C++, a new-line character can be specified as \n (i.e., a backslash character followed by a lowercase n). For example:
This produces the following output:
 
 
Alternatively, the endl manipulator can also be used to break lines. For example:
Output
 


Example 2.1
Following program shows the use of Newline Escape Sequence (\n)

Output
 

Your turn: Edit above given code and use endl manipulator.

Example 2.2
This program shows the use of Horizontal tab Escape Sequence (\t)
 
Output
Now try escape sequences \\ , \' , \" yourself. Example 2.3
Program using multiple insertion operations (<<)

Output

iomanip
iomanip is a library that is used to manipulate the output of C++ program. Below are some Parametric manipulators
1.	setw
It is used to sets the field width to be used on output operations.
Example
Now compile your code and see what the output is.
 
2.	setprecision
It is used to sets the decimal precision to be used to format floating-point values on output operations.
Example
Output

 
Exercise:
Problem 01

Write your first program saying, “Hello World”. Now change the program to print your name and roll number instead.
Problem 02

Write a program that prints the arrow pointing up using COUT statement.



Problem 03

Write a program that prints the house using COUT & setw statement.

Note: Use setw function instead of space character
 
Problem 04

Write a program to print the chrismas tree using just ONE COUT statement & setw function


Note: Use setw function instead of space character
